<details>
<summary>The flow is divided into front-end and back-end stages:</summary>
**1. Specification:**
- Define system-level functionality, performance, power, and area requirements.
- Decide on architecture and high-level design specifications.
  
**2. Architecture Design:**
- Plan the system architecture, including processor, memory, and interconnects.
- Allocate resources and create block-level diagrams.

**3. RTL Design (Register Transfer Level):**
- Write the functional design using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL.
- Implement the digital logic design.

**4. Functional Verification:**
- Verify the RTL design against the specifications.
- Use testbenches, simulations, and formal verification to ensure correctness.

**6. Synthesis:**
- Convert the RTL code into a gate-level netlist using a synthesis tool.
- Optimize for area, power, and timing constraints.

**6. Design for Testability (DFT):**

## Day 1: Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
**1. Understanding the Chip Package and Wire Bonding:**

 In embedded boards, what we call the "chip" is actually its packageâ€”a protective casing around the actual chip. The chip itself is typically located at the center of the 
 package, with connections established using the wire bonding method, a basic wired connection.
 
**2. Structure of a Semiconductor Die:**

Inside a chip, signals to and from the external world pass through pads. The core, housing the chip's digital logic, is surrounded by these pads. Together, the core and pads form the die, the fundamental unit of semiconductor manufacturing.

**3. Foundries, IPs, and Macros in Semiconductor Manufacturing:**

A foundry is where semiconductor chips are manufactured. Foundry IPs are specialized intellectual properties requiring advanced expertise, while repeatable digital logic blocks are known as macros.

### Understanding ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
- **Compilation:** The C program is compiled into assembly language using a specific ISA, such as RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - V).
- **Conversion:** The assembly code is then translated into machine language (binary logic 0s and 1s) that the hardware understands.
- **Implementation:** The RISC-V specification is implemented using an RTL (Register Transfer Level) hardware description language.
- **Physical Design:** The RTL is converted into a physical layout using the standard PnR (Place and Route) or RTL-to-GDSII flow.
